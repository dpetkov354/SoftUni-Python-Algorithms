# SoftUni-Python-Algorithms

The Algorithms course introduces participants to the most common programming techniques. Along with this, numerous algorithmic tasks are solved and an analysis of various approaches is carried out - their properties, applications, advantages and disadvantages. You will develop your algorithmic thinking skills and acquire skills in working with the main classes of algorithms used in practice: recursion and backtracking, recursion using variables, searching and sorting, as well as graph theory - implementation in computer memory, minimum spanning tree , traversal and finding the shortest path. You will also learn the technique of dynamic programming and solve famous problems such as the Fibonacci sequence, finding the longest common sequence and the longest sequence of increasing elements.
